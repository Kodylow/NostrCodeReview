# Getting Started with Nostr Data Vending Machines: A Distributed Marketplace for AI Agents, Jobs, and Services

This Repl is a quick tutorial on how to get started building NIP-90 clients and services on Nostr aka Data Vending Machines (DVMs). I built it based off the Replit Hack Night project I did a few days ago so the code is EXTREMELY hacky, but I wanted to get a resource out ASAP to help you build Nostr AI Clients and Services for the bounties we posted as part of the AI4ALL Hackathon, see here for a complete list: https://replit.com/bounties?search=AI4ALL

> "Nostr can act as a marketplace for data processing, where users request jobs to be processed in certain ways (e.g. "speech-to-text", "summarization"), but where they don't necessarily care about "who" processes the data,"

> "This NIP is not to be confused with a 1:1 marketplace; but rather, a flow where user announces a desired output, willingness to pay, and service providers compete to fulfill the job requirement in the best way possible."

This is a fast developing project/space and I wanted to get this tutorial out to help you if you want to try for one of the AI4ALL Hackathon Replit Bounties: earn $200 for buildling a DVM client (frontend for posting jobs) or service (backend for performing jobs in exchange for bitcoin).
